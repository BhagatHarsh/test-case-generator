## Input Screen  
Enter the constraints here  
_Make sure that none of the constraints is having **values more than 10<sup>7</sup> and T*maximum_value_of_n/m/k <=10<sup>7</sup>**   
> This limit is applied because Outputs are in the form of arrays, and any array having size more than that would completely use up memory of
> a standard PC and would cause it to hang. This issue is under consideration and would be removed soon.
