# Test-case-generator  
#### Generate test cases for Competitive Coding.  
Download Zip file [here](https://github.com/Tanmay-901/Important-details/raw/master/test_case.zip) and then extract 
the file, open dist folder, and then run test_case.exe(keep all the files at same location)
For more convinience,
1. right click on 'test_case.exe' after extraction.
2. click on `pin to start`.
3. Now the tool's icon is pinned to your start menu and can be used directly from there which saves the hussle of going 
inside the `dist` folder everytime you want to run the tool.

## To be kept in mind:
* This is a **plug'n'play** tool i.e. no installation is required
* There could be a case when your web browser or windows defender shows a warning regarding security issue or virus
detected and in that case, you would either have to pause your antivirus and/or windows defender for the time being before downloading(can be resumed
right after downloading completes).
* If the pc shows a warning similar to this "Operation did not complete because the file contains a virus or unwanted file", it is 
probably due to an issue with **py2exe** and **pyinstaller** which are used to convert the python program into an executable file. It can be overcome by 
allowing "insatallation from unknown sources" and setting it up as "Ask always" under the privacy settings.

## About Project  
* This project is a combined application of Object Oriented Programming, Competitive coding and Tkinter toolkit.  
* I got the motivation to develop this project after I begun my competitive programming journey(not a great one yet though but working my way up gradually), 
there were many times when I saw people(including me and my friends) stuck on trying to struggle in thinking test cases when their program 
fails the submission, especially the case with beginners and that is the main reason this project is developed.
* However it is not advised to dircetly use this tool everytime without trying and thinking test cases on your own, but 
treat it like a solved problem, you should try to solve the problem first before looking up the solution and if you're unable to get ahead 
then it is advisable to go for the solution instead of just wasting more time. Treat this tool similarly.
  
## Home Page: 
Click on the desired type of Test Case.  
![Home Page](https://github.com/Tanmay-901/test-case-generator/blob/master/Images/Home.png)
## Input Screen  
Enter the constraints here  
_Make sure that none of the constraints is having **values more than 10<sup>7</sup> and T*maximum_value_of_n/m/k <=10<sup>7</sup>**   
> This limit is applied because Outputs are in the form of arrays, and any array having size more than that would completely use up memory of
> a standard PC and would cause it to hang. This issue is under consideration and would be soon dealt with.

## Output Screen  
Finally Output is shown.

On the output screen you can use multiple handy features as well like copy, regenerate new test case, change constraints
on single click.

------------------------
## Pre-requisites:  
* To use codes apart from first release, 'tkinter' must be installed.  
-------------------------
## Updates:
* ~~Snapshots of the application will be uploaded soon~~.
* ~~GUI is working properly in `test_case.py` for the all the current test case types~~.
* New test case types are being added continuously.
